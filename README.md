#### Jose Camacho Collados and Mohammad Taher Pilehvar

The following repository includes the pre-trained embeddings and preprocessed text classification datasets for the paper *[On the Role of Text Preprocessing in Neural Network Architectures: An Evaluation Study on Text Categorization and Sentiment Analysis]()* .

### Pre-trained word embeddings

We release the 300-dimension word embeddings used in our experiments, trained on UMBC with the following preprocessing techniques:

- **Simple tokenization**: Download [here]() [~300 MB]
- **Lowercased**: Download [here]() [~300 MB]
- **Lemmatized**: Download [here]() [~300 MB]
- **Multiword-grouped**: Download [here]() [~300 MB]

### Proprocessed datasets

We also release the text categorization and sentiment analysis datasets already preprocessed.

- **Text categorization**: Available [here]() [~300 MB]
- **Sentiment analysis**: Available [here]() [~300 MB]

Note: If you use any of these datasets, please acknowledge the original sources that you can find in our paper.
